[摘要] 
        
          Background
          Hemophilia A and B are caused by variants in the factor (F) VIII or FIX gene. Selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in genetic databases.
        
        
          Objectives
          To compare the spectrum of F8 and F9 variants in an international population-based pediatric cohort (PedNet Registry) with the spectrum found in the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B Mutation Project (CHAMP/CHBMP) databases.
        
        
          Methods
          All patients registered in the PedNet Registry on January 1, 2021 were included in this study. As comparators, data from patients with severe hemophilia included in the CHAMP/CHBMP registry (US center data) and EAHAD were used.
        
        
          Results
          Genetic information was available for 1941 patients. Intron 22 inversion was present in 52% of patients with severe hemophilia A; frameshift (36%), missense (28%), and nonsense (20%) were the most frequent variants in patients with severe hemophilia A who were inversion-negative. The most frequent variants in severe hemophilia B were missense (48%). In nonsevere disease, most variants were missense variants (moderate hemophilia A: 91%; mild hemophilia A: 95%, moderate and mild hemophilia B: 86% each). Comparison with the databases demonstrated a higher proportion of missense variants associated with severe hemophilia B in EAHAD (68%) than in PedNet (48%) and CHBMP (46%).
        
        
          Conclusion
          The PedNet population-based cohort provides an alternative to the established databases, which collect data by selective reporting, as it is a well-maintained database covering the full spectrum of pathogenic F8 and F9 variants, and indicates the number of patients affected by each particular variant.

The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3].

In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease.

The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance.

Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files).

FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16].

In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported.

In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45). In addition, genetic testing was performed in 80% patients with hemophilia B having a known family history (n = 187/234), in 88% of sporadic cases (n = 116/132), and in 88% of patients without the information on family history (n = 7/8).

FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16]. Genotyping was performed locally by each center’s established routines, testing for inversions and predominantly using Sanger sequencing. In more recent years, next-generation sequencing has been used in some centers. All genetic reports provided to the coordinating center were checked and revised according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported. In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45). In addition, genetic testing was performed in 80% patients with hemophilia B having a known family history (n = 187/234), in 88% of sporadic cases (n = 116/132), and in 88% of patients without the information on family history (n = 7/8). The distribution of variant effects is shown in Table 1 (for hemophilia A) and Table 2 (for hemophilia B).Table 1Distribution of variant effects across severities in boys with hemophilia A, included in the PedNet Registry.MissenseNonsenseSilentSplice sitePromoterFrameshiftSmall structural change (<50 bp)Large structural change (>50 bp)IntronInversionTotalSevere151 (13)110 (9.6)38 (3.3)1 (0.6)194 (16.9)3 (0.3)40 (3.5)614 (53.3)1151Moderate157 (91.3)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)6 (3.5)5 (2.9)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)172Mild293 (95.1)1 (0.3)3 (1.0)3 (1.0)2 (0.6)4 (1.3)2 (0.6)308Total601111247419964426151631Only male patients with a known variant are shown in the Table.Data are presented as numbers (percentage).

However, although among patients with moderate hemophilia A these variants were almost equally distributed between the A1 (19%), A2 (23%), A3 (21%), and C1 (21%) domains, they were located most frequently in the A2 domain (40%) in patients with mild hemophilia A (Figure 1A).Figure 1Location of missense variants in moderate and mild hemophilia.

The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease. On the other hand, databases on a gene-by-gene basis (ie, locus-specific databases [LSDB]) are run by researchers with scientific expertise in a particular gene or phenotype and are a crucial tool for both diagnostic and research laboratories. The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance. Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files). In this study, we described the full spectrum of pathogenic F8/F9 variants in the PedNet cohort and compared how this population-based spectrum conformed to the spectrum of variants found in the established reference databases of EAHAD and CHAMP/CHBMP [[11], [12], [13]].

As in hemophilia A, the distribution of these variants differed between moderate and mild hemophilia B. Most missense variants occurred in the serine protease domain in both groups (51% for moderate hemophilia B and 60% for mild hemophilia B). Yet, mild hemophilia B was associated more frequently with variants in the EGF1-domain whereas variants in the pro-peptide or linker were found less frequently (Figure 1B). The distribution of missense variants between the heavy and light chains was very similar among patients with hemophilia B.

The distribution of variant effects is shown in Table 1 (for hemophilia A) and Table 2 (for hemophilia B).Table 1Distribution of variant effects across severities in boys with hemophilia A, included in the PedNet Registry.MissenseNonsenseSilentSplice sitePromoterFrameshiftSmall structural change (<50 bp)Large structural change (>50 bp)IntronInversionTotalSevere151 (13)110 (9.6)38 (3.3)1 (0.6)194 (16.9)3 (0.3)40 (3.5)614 (53.3)1151Moderate157 (91.3)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)6 (3.5)5 (2.9)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)172Mild293 (95.1)1 (0.3)3 (1.0)3 (1.0)2 (0.6)4 (1.3)2 (0.6)308Total601111247419964426151631Only male patients with a known variant are shown in the Table.Data are presented as numbers (percentage).

In patients with both moderate (n = 172) and mild (n = 308) hemophilia A, missense variants encompassed the most common variant effect and accounted for 157 of the moderate (91%) and 293 of the mild cases (95%). However, although among patients with moderate hemophilia A these variants were almost equally distributed between the A1 (19%), A2 (23%), A3 (21%), and C1 (21%) domains, they were located most frequently in the A2 domain (40%) in patients with mild hemophilia A (Figure 1A).Figure 1Location of missense variants in moderate and mild hemophilia. (A) Location according to the factor VIII protein domains in moderate or mild hemophilia A; (B) Location according to the factor IX protein structure in moderate or mild hemophilia B. GLA: c-carboxy glutamic acid domain; EGF: epidermal growth factor like domain; ACT-Peptide: activating peptide In both moderate (n = 79) and mild (n = 71) hemophilia B, missense variants represented the causative variant effect in most patients: 68 of moderate and 61 of mild cases (86% each). As in hemophilia A, the distribution of these variants differed between moderate and mild hemophilia B. Most missense variants occurred in the serine protease domain in both groups (51% for moderate hemophilia B and 60% for mild hemophilia B). Yet, mild hemophilia B was associated more frequently with variants in the EGF1-domain whereas variants in the pro-peptide or linker were found less frequently (Figure 1B). The distribution of missense variants between the heavy and light chains was very similar among patients with hemophilia B. For the comparison between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP/CHBMP US files, only inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A were included. The spectrum in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was almost identical between the databases (Figure 2).Figure 2Spectrum of variant effects in the PedNet cohort compared with the CHAMP/CHBMP US files and EAHAD database. (A) inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A;(B) severe hemophilia B patients. Data are presented in percentages. Comparing the PedNet cohort to the EAHAD and CHBMP database, missense variants were the most prevalent variant effects in each database (Figure 2). 

The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease. On the other hand, databases on a gene-by-gene basis (ie, locus-specific databases [LSDB]) are run by researchers with scientific expertise in a particular gene or phenotype and are a crucial tool for both diagnostic and research laboratories. The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance. Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files). In this study, we described the full spectrum of pathogenic F8/F9 variants in the PedNet cohort and compared how this population-based spectrum conformed to the spectrum of variants found in the established reference databases of EAHAD and CHAMP/CHBMP [[11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, we showed that the data from the PedNet cohort could serve as a reference for studies in previously untreated patients (PUPs). FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16]. Genotyping was performed locally by each center’s established routines, testing for inversions and predominantly using Sanger sequencing. In more recent years, next-generation sequencing has been used in some centers. All genetic reports provided to the coordinating center were checked and revised according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported. In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45).

(A) inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A;(B) severe hemophilia B patients. Data are presented in percentages. Comparing the PedNet cohort to the EAHAD and CHBMP database, missense variants were the most prevalent variant effects in each database (Figure 2). First of all, we found that 50% of our patients with severe hemophilia A had an intron 22 inversion, compared with 43% in the CHAMP-US cohort and a widely accepted prevalence of approximately 45% [19]. However, the PedNet cohort is the first large and population-based cohort providing data on the prevalence of intron 22 inversions and should therefore be considered as an additional benchmark. Additionally, the distribution of variant effects in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was very similar between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP-US file: frameshift, missense, and nonsense variants were the most frequent variant effects in these patients. In patients with severe hemophilia B, missense variants occurred most commonly, a finding that was again comparable to the other databases.

In patients with severe hemophilia B, missense variants occurred most commonly, a finding that was again comparable to the other databases. Next, we studied the distribution of variants in patients with nonsevere hemophilia. Although missense variants were the most frequent variant effects both in patients with moderate and mild hemophilia, we found that their location differed depending on the severity of the disease. Indeed, missense variants associated with mild hemophilia A were located most frequently in the A2 domain, whereas these were more evenly distributed between the A1, A2, A3, and C1 domains in moderate cases. Consequently, the heavy chain was more likely to be affected in patients with mild hemophilia A than in those with moderate hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, variants in mild hemophilia B occurred more frequently in the EGF1 domain but less frequently in the pro-peptide and linker than in moderate hemophilia B. The impact of variants on the FVIII or FIX protein structure and consequently on the disease severity is a topic of current research [[20], [21], [22], [23]] and evidence is emerging that phenotypic variation may also be related to the region where the variant occurs. [20,21] However, the role of the location of the variant warrants further exploration.

Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45). In addition, genetic testing was performed in 80% patients with hemophilia B having a known family history (n = 187/234), in 88% of sporadic cases (n = 116/132), and in 88% of patients without the information on family history (n = 7/8). The distribution of variant effects is shown in Table 1 (for hemophilia A) and Table 2 (for hemophilia B).Table 1Distribution of variant effects across severities in boys with hemophilia A, included in the PedNet Registry.MissenseNonsenseSilentSplice sitePromoterFrameshiftSmall structural change (<50 bp)Large structural change (>50 bp)IntronInversionTotalSevere151 (13)110 (9.6)38 (3.3)1 (0.6)194 (16.9)3 (0.3)40 (3.5)614 (53.3)1151Moderate157 (91.3)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)6 (3.5)5 (2.9)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)172Mild293 (95.1)1 (0.3)3 (1.0)3 (1.0)2 (0.6)4 (1.3)2 (0.6)308Total601111247419964426151631Only male patients with a known variant are shown in the Table.Data are presented as numbers (percentage).

In patients with both moderate (n = 172) and mild (n = 308) hemophilia A, missense variants encompassed the most common variant effect and accounted for 157 of the moderate (91%) and 293 of the mild cases (95%). However, although among patients with moderate hemophilia A these variants were almost equally distributed between the A1 (19%), A2 (23%), A3 (21%), and C1 (21%) domains, they were located most frequently in the A2 domain (40%) in patients with mild hemophilia A (Figure 1A).Figure 1Location of missense variants in moderate and mild hemophilia. (A) Location according to the factor VIII protein domains in moderate or mild hemophilia A; (B) Location according to the factor IX protein structure in moderate or mild hemophilia B. GLA: c-carboxy glutamic acid domain; EGF: epidermal growth factor like domain; ACT-Peptide: activating peptide In both moderate (n = 79) and mild (n = 71) hemophilia B, missense variants represented the causative variant effect in most patients: 68 of moderate and 61 of mild cases (86% each). As in hemophilia A, the distribution of these variants differed between moderate and mild hemophilia B. Most missense variants occurred in the serine protease domain in both groups (51% for moderate hemophilia B and 60% for mild hemophilia B). Yet, mild hemophilia B was associated more frequently with variants in the EGF1-domain whereas variants in the pro-peptide or linker were found less frequently (Figure 1B). The distribution of missense variants between the heavy and light chains was very similar among patients with hemophilia B. For the comparison between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP/CHBMP US files, only inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A were included. The spectrum in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was almost identical between the databases (Figure 2).Figure 2Spectrum of variant effects in the PedNet cohort compared with the CHAMP/CHBMP US files and EAHAD database. (A) inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A;(B) severe hemophilia B patients. Data are presented in percentages. Comparing the PedNet cohort to the EAHAD and CHBMP database, missense variants were the most prevalent variant effects in each database (Figure 2). First of all, we found that 50% of our patients with severe hemophilia A had an intron 22 inversion, compared with 43% in the CHAMP-US cohort and a widely accepted prevalence of approximately 45% [19]. However, the PedNet cohort is the first large and population-based cohort providing data on the prevalence of intron 22 inversions and should therefore be considered as an additional benchmark. Additionally, the distribution of variant effects in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was very similar between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP-US file: frameshift, missense, and nonsense variants were the most frequent variant effects in these patients. In patients with severe hemophilia B, missense variants occurred most commonly, a finding that was again comparable to the other databases. Next, we studied the distribution of variants in patients with nonsevere hemophilia. Although missense variants were the most frequent variant effects both in patients with moderate and mild hemophilia, we found that their location differed depending on the severity of the disease. Indeed, missense variants associated with mild hemophilia A were located most frequently in the A2 domain, whereas these were more evenly distributed between the A1, A2, A3, and C1 domains in moderate cases. Consequently, the heavy chain was more likely to be affected in patients with mild hemophilia A than in those with moderate hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, variants in mild hemophilia B occurred more frequently in the EGF1 domain but less frequently in the pro-peptide and linker than in moderate hemophilia B. The impact of variants on the FVIII or FIX protein structure and consequently on the disease severity is a topic of current research [[20], [21], [22], [23]] and evidence is emerging that phenotypic variation may also be related to the region where the variant occurs. [20,21] However, the role of the location of the variant warrants further exploration. In addition, no disease-causing variant could be identified in the respective genes in 2% of our patients with hemophilia A and 1% of patients with hemophilia B, which is comparable with the CHAMP data and with some reports [[24], [25], [26]], but low in comparison with other studies, that failed to identify a disease-causing variant in up to 11% of the patients. [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]] Of note, recent evolutions in genetic testing have improved variant detection and may explain the differences between various studies. 

The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease. On the other hand, databases on a gene-by-gene basis (ie, locus-specific databases [LSDB]) are run by researchers with scientific expertise in a particular gene or phenotype and are a crucial tool for both diagnostic and research laboratories. The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance. Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files). In this study, we described the full spectrum of pathogenic F8/F9 variants in the PedNet cohort and compared how this population-based spectrum conformed to the spectrum of variants found in the established reference databases of EAHAD and CHAMP/CHBMP [[11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, we showed that the data from the PedNet cohort could serve as a reference for studies in previously untreated patients (PUPs). FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16]. Genotyping was performed locally by each center’s established routines, testing for inversions and predominantly using Sanger sequencing. In more recent years, next-generation sequencing has been used in some centers. All genetic reports provided to the coordinating center were checked and revised according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported. In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B.

[[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]] Of note, recent evolutions in genetic testing have improved variant detection and may explain the differences between various studies. Furthermore, we also evaluated whether the spectrum of variants in severe hemophilia was different according to the family history. Interestingly, missense variants were less common in sporadic cases of severe hemophilia A, whereas in patients with severe hemophilia B no differences were observed. A study by Lu et al. [32] reported similar results in patients with hemophilia B, but a comparison of the spectrum between sporadic and familial cases has not yet been studied extensively. Note that the definition of sporadic cases in our cohort is based on the lack of other symptomatic/diagnosed cases in the family rather than on the genetic test result of the patient’s mother. Importantly, haplotyping in hemophilia B has shown that, particularly in mild disease, seemingly sporadic cases could be related without anyone knowing [33], which may influence our observations.

Indeed, missense variants associated with mild hemophilia A were located most frequently in the A2 domain, whereas these were more evenly distributed between the A1, A2, A3, and C1 domains in moderate cases. Consequently, the heavy chain was more likely to be affected in patients with mild hemophilia A than in those with moderate hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, variants in mild hemophilia B occurred more frequently in the EGF1 domain but less frequently in the pro-peptide and linker than in moderate hemophilia B. The impact of variants on the FVIII or FIX protein structure and consequently on the disease severity is a topic of current research [[20], [21], [22], [23]] and evidence is emerging that phenotypic variation may also be related to the region where the variant occurs. [20,21] However, the role of the location of the variant warrants further exploration. In addition, no disease-causing variant could be identified in the respective genes in 2% of our patients with hemophilia A and 1% of patients with hemophilia B, which is comparable with the CHAMP data and with some reports [[24], [25], [26]], but low in comparison with other studies, that failed to identify a disease-causing variant in up to 11% of the patients. [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]] Of note, recent evolutions in genetic testing have improved variant detection and may explain the differences between various studies. Furthermore, we also evaluated whether the spectrum of variants in severe hemophilia was different according to the family history. Interestingly, missense variants were less common in sporadic cases of severe hemophilia A, whereas in patients with severe hemophilia B no differences were observed. A study by Lu et al. [32] reported similar results in patients with hemophilia B, but a comparison of the spectrum between sporadic and familial cases has not yet been studied extensively. Note that the definition of sporadic cases in our cohort is based on the lack of other symptomatic/diagnosed cases in the family rather than on the genetic test result of the patient’s mother. Importantly, haplotyping in hemophilia B has shown that, particularly in mild disease, seemingly sporadic cases could be related without anyone knowing [33], which may influence our observations. Finally, in view of inhibitor development, it is extremely important to have a correct variant spectrum frame to interpret the results of studies in PUPs in the light of their representation as the hemophilia population. Three LSDBs are currently used: CHAMP (F8 variants), CHBMP (F9 variants), and EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases (F8 and F9 variants). The development of these databases has much improved the accessibility of information on the location of a variant within the gene, the associated disease severity, and the risk of inhibitor development. In addition, all variants described in these databases conform to a common nomenclature following the Human Genome Variation Society guidelines. Nevertheless, these LSDBs have some limitations. First, they have been built starting from previous LSDBs or central mutation databases, supplemented and updated with variants found through literature searches or through submission by individual laboratories or researchers. Therefore, a reporting bias can affect their accuracy and completeness. Next, the CHAMP/CHMBP Mutation Lists are listings of variants. As they do not indicate the number of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, extrapolating the frequency of a variant to frequencies of patients affected by that variant is not possible based on these data. Indeed, the CHAMP Mutation List only includes 2 listings for inversion (ie, intron 1 inversion and intron 22 inversion), although over 40% of cases of severe hemophilia A are caused by inversions. On the contrary, in the CHAMP/CHBMP US files, each row does correspond to a patient included in the population-based Haemophilia Inhibitor Research Study Investigators [14]. Finally, F8 inversions are not listed in the EAHAD database. In this study, we report the full spectrum of F8/F9 variants in a multicenter large population-based cohort of PUPs affected with hemophilia A or B. Therefore, the spectrum of variants presented here can serve as a population-based reference and could be useful in future studies, although the database itself is not freely accessible. 

The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease. On the other hand, databases on a gene-by-gene basis (ie, locus-specific databases [LSDB]) are run by researchers with scientific expertise in a particular gene or phenotype and are a crucial tool for both diagnostic and research laboratories. The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance. Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files). In this study, we described the full spectrum of pathogenic F8/F9 variants in the PedNet cohort and compared how this population-based spectrum conformed to the spectrum of variants found in the established reference databases of EAHAD and CHAMP/CHBMP [[11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, we showed that the data from the PedNet cohort could serve as a reference for studies in previously untreated patients (PUPs). FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16]. Genotyping was performed locally by each center’s established routines, testing for inversions and predominantly using Sanger sequencing. In more recent years, next-generation sequencing has been used in some centers. All genetic reports provided to the coordinating center were checked and revised according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported. In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45). In addition, genetic testing was performed in 80% patients with hemophilia B having a known family history (n = 187/234), in 88% of sporadic cases (n = 116/132), and in 88% of patients without the information on family history (n = 7/8). The distribution of variant effects is shown in Table 1 (for hemophilia A) and Table 2 (for hemophilia B).Table 1Distribution of variant effects across severities in boys with hemophilia A, included in the PedNet Registry.MissenseNonsenseSilentSplice sitePromoterFrameshiftSmall structural change (<50 bp)Large structural change (>50 bp)IntronInversionTotalSevere151 (13)110 (9.6)38 (3.3)1 (0.6)194 (16.9)3 (0.3)40 (3.5)614 (53.3)1151Moderate157 (91.3)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)6 (3.5)5 (2.9)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)172Mild293 (95.1)1 (0.3)3 (1.0)3 (1.0)2 (0.6)4 (1.3)2 (0.6)308Total601111247419964426151631Only male patients with a known variant are shown in the Table.Data are presented as numbers (percentage).

In patients with both moderate (n = 172) and mild (n = 308) hemophilia A, missense variants encompassed the most common variant effect and accounted for 157 of the moderate (91%) and 293 of the mild cases (95%). However, although among patients with moderate hemophilia A these variants were almost equally distributed between the A1 (19%), A2 (23%), A3 (21%), and C1 (21%) domains, they were located most frequently in the A2 domain (40%) in patients with mild hemophilia A (Figure 1A).Figure 1Location of missense variants in moderate and mild hemophilia. (A) Location according to the factor VIII protein domains in moderate or mild hemophilia A; (B) Location according to the factor IX protein structure in moderate or mild hemophilia B. GLA: c-carboxy glutamic acid domain; EGF: epidermal growth factor like domain; ACT-Peptide: activating peptide In both moderate (n = 79) and mild (n = 71) hemophilia B, missense variants represented the causative variant effect in most patients: 68 of moderate and 61 of mild cases (86% each). As in hemophilia A, the distribution of these variants differed between moderate and mild hemophilia B. Most missense variants occurred in the serine protease domain in both groups (51% for moderate hemophilia B and 60% for mild hemophilia B). Yet, mild hemophilia B was associated more frequently with variants in the EGF1-domain whereas variants in the pro-peptide or linker were found less frequently (Figure 1B). The distribution of missense variants between the heavy and light chains was very similar among patients with hemophilia B. For the comparison between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP/CHBMP US files, only inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A were included. The spectrum in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was almost identical between the databases (Figure 2).Figure 2Spectrum of variant effects in the PedNet cohort compared with the CHAMP/CHBMP US files and EAHAD database. (A) inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A;(B) severe hemophilia B patients. Data are presented in percentages. Comparing the PedNet cohort to the EAHAD and CHBMP database, missense variants were the most prevalent variant effects in each database (Figure 2). First of all, we found that 50% of our patients with severe hemophilia A had an intron 22 inversion, compared with 43% in the CHAMP-US cohort and a widely accepted prevalence of approximately 45% [19]. However, the PedNet cohort is the first large and population-based cohort providing data on the prevalence of intron 22 inversions and should therefore be considered as an additional benchmark. Additionally, the distribution of variant effects in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was very similar between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP-US file: frameshift, missense, and nonsense variants were the most frequent variant effects in these patients. In patients with severe hemophilia B, missense variants occurred most commonly, a finding that was again comparable to the other databases. Next, we studied the distribution of variants in patients with nonsevere hemophilia. Although missense variants were the most frequent variant effects both in patients with moderate and mild hemophilia, we found that their location differed depending on the severity of the disease. Indeed, missense variants associated with mild hemophilia A were located most frequently in the A2 domain, whereas these were more evenly distributed between the A1, A2, A3, and C1 domains in moderate cases. Consequently, the heavy chain was more likely to be affected in patients with mild hemophilia A than in those with moderate hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, variants in mild hemophilia B occurred more frequently in the EGF1 domain but less frequently in the pro-peptide and linker than in moderate hemophilia B. The impact of variants on the FVIII or FIX protein structure and consequently on the disease severity is a topic of current research [[20], [21], [22], [23]] and evidence is emerging that phenotypic variation may also be related to the region where the variant occurs. [20,21] However, the role of the location of the variant warrants further exploration. In addition, no disease-causing variant could be identified in the respective genes in 2% of our patients with hemophilia A and 1% of patients with hemophilia B, which is comparable with the CHAMP data and with some reports [[24], [25], [26]], but low in comparison with other studies, that failed to identify a disease-causing variant in up to 11% of the patients. [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]] Of note, recent evolutions in genetic testing have improved variant detection and may explain the differences between various studies. Furthermore, we also evaluated whether the spectrum of variants in severe hemophilia was different according to the family history. Interestingly, missense variants were less common in sporadic cases of severe hemophilia A, whereas in patients with severe hemophilia B no differences were observed. A study by Lu et al. [32] reported similar results in patients with hemophilia B, but a comparison of the spectrum between sporadic and familial cases has not yet been studied extensively. Note that the definition of sporadic cases in our cohort is based on the lack of other symptomatic/diagnosed cases in the family rather than on the genetic test result of the patient’s mother. Importantly, haplotyping in hemophilia B has shown that, particularly in mild disease, seemingly sporadic cases could be related without anyone knowing [33], which may influence our observations. Finally, in view of inhibitor development, it is extremely important to have a correct variant spectrum frame to interpret the results of studies in PUPs in the light of their representation as the hemophilia population. Three LSDBs are currently used: CHAMP (F8 variants), CHBMP (F9 variants), and EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases (F8 and F9 variants).

In addition, all variants described in these databases conform to a common nomenclature following the Human Genome Variation Society guidelines. Nevertheless, these LSDBs have some limitations. First, they have been built starting from previous LSDBs or central mutation databases, supplemented and updated with variants found through literature searches or through submission by individual laboratories or researchers. Therefore, a reporting bias can affect their accuracy and completeness. Next, the CHAMP/CHMBP Mutation Lists are listings of variants. As they do not indicate the number of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, extrapolating the frequency of a variant to frequencies of patients affected by that variant is not possible based on these data. Indeed, the CHAMP Mutation List only includes 2 listings for inversion (ie, intron 1 inversion and intron 22 inversion), although over 40% of cases of severe hemophilia A are caused by inversions. On the contrary, in the CHAMP/CHBMP US files, each row does correspond to a patient included in the population-based Haemophilia Inhibitor Research Study Investigators [14]. Finally, F8 inversions are not listed in the EAHAD database. In this study, we report the full spectrum of F8/F9 variants in a multicenter large population-based cohort of PUPs affected with hemophilia A or B. Therefore, the spectrum of variants presented here can serve as a population-based reference and could be useful in future studies, although the database itself is not freely accessible. Our study has some limitations. First, the PedNet Registry only collects data from patients younger than 18 years. Additionally, patients with mild hemophilia and FVIII or FIX levels above 25% were not included. Thus, patients with mild hemophilia and/or a less severe phenotype may be underrepresented, especially if there was no known family history. However, in 2001 and again in 2014, the Scientific Subcommittee on Factor VIII and Factor IX and Rare Coagulation Disorders of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommended classifying hemophilia as mild if the plasma FVIII or FIX levels were between 5% and 40% [15,34]. Therefore, the EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases and the CHAMP/CHBMP US files may include patients with mild hemophilia having FVIII or FIX levels between 25% and 40%, whereas the PedNet registry does not. Second, some females with hemophilia are included in the PedNet Registry, but they most likely do not represent all female patients with hemophilia. Therefore, data on females have not been analyzed in this study. Additionally, detailed information on ethnicity is not available and although we included patients from Europe, Canada and Israel, some ethnic groups may be underrepresented. In addition, we do not report on second variants. Although 2 pathogenic variants are probably rare and the clinical significance is still unresolved [[35], [36], [37], [38]], they should be considered in patients with a known disease-causing variant but unusual phenotype, but also in genetic counseling settings. Finally, genetic analysis has not been performed in some patients. Patients with severe hemophilia A and severe or moderate hemophilia B were more likely to be tested but genetic testing was less frequently performed in patients with severe hemophilia A having a known family history, most likely because the disease-causing variant was already known. However, reporting the variant is not allowed in the PedNet Registry, unless confirmed in the patient himself. This may have caused a bias in our data.
