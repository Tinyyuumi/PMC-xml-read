[摘要] 
        
          Background
          Hemophilia A and B are caused by variants in the factor (F) VIII or FIX gene. Selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in genetic databases.
        
        
          Objectives
          To compare the spectrum of F8 and F9 variants in an international population-based pediatric cohort (PedNet Registry) with the spectrum found in the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B Mutation Project (CHAMP/CHBMP) databases.
        
        
          Methods
          All patients registered in the PedNet Registry on January 1, 2021 were included in this study. As comparators, data from patients with severe hemophilia included in the CHAMP/CHBMP registry (US center data) and EAHAD were used.
        
        
          Results
          Genetic information was available for 1941 patients. Intron 22 inversion was present in 52% of patients with severe hemophilia A; frameshift (36%), missense (28%), and nonsense (20%) were the most frequent variants in patients with severe hemophilia A who were inversion-negative. The most frequent variants in severe hemophilia B were missense (48%). In nonsevere disease, most variants were missense variants (moderate hemophilia A: 91%; mild hemophilia A: 95%, moderate and mild hemophilia B: 86% each). Comparison with the databases demonstrated a higher proportion of missense variants associated with severe hemophilia B in EAHAD (68%) than in PedNet (48%) and CHBMP (46%).
        
        
          Conclusion
          The PedNet population-based cohort provides an alternative to the established databases, which collect data by selective reporting, as it is a well-maintained database covering the full spectrum of pathogenic F8 and F9 variants, and indicates the number of patients affected by each particular variant.

0: The discovery of the genes encoding human coagulation factors, factor (F) VIII and FIX in the 1980s [1,2] enabled the identification of disease-causing variants in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. The identification of a disease-causing variant in the FVIII/FIX genes (F8/F9) is important for determining carriership in women and for prenatal diagnosis, and it helps to predict the severity of hemophilia in the child. In addition, the variant type has been shown to predispose to inhibitor development [3]. 

1: Advances in sequencing techniques have increased the identification of variants and have prompted the creation of databases to increase the knowledge on the genetic background of hemophilia. General or central mutation databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [4] and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [5] contain a list of variants in all genes. However, the curators of these central databases are not necessarily experts in all the relevant genes. Therefore, these databases lack important characteristics for full clinical interpretation of a specific disease. 

2: On the other hand, databases on a gene-by-gene basis (ie, locus-specific databases [LSDB]) are run by researchers with scientific expertise in a particular gene or phenotype and are a crucial tool for both diagnostic and research laboratories. The first LSDBs for F8 and F9 were established in the early 1990s [6,7]. Subsequently, web-based LSDBs such as the Haemophilia A Mutation, Structure, and Test Site (HAMSTeRS) and Hemobase [[8], [9], [10]] have been created. However, lack of available time and funding can have an impact on the maintenance of these databases, and if not updated regularly, a database loses its relevance. Moreover, these databases are not always easily accessible. 

3: Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a variant list in an easily accessible format (CDC Hemophilia A Mutation Project [CHAMP] or Hemophilia B Mutation Project [CHBMP] database) and this list is updated quarterly with recently published variants [11,12]. In addition, evolving from previously developed databases, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) established a project with the aim of gathering single gene variant databases involved in clinical bleeding disorders and providing a single web portal to LSDBs for the genes related to hemostasis [13]. To date, over 3000 unique pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A and >1200 unique variants causing hemophilia B have been listed in the EAHAD coagulation factor variant database and CHAMP/CHBMP databases. These databases contain information on the variants previously reported in other LSDBs and those newly published in the literature. The EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases also include variants directly submitted by laboratories. However, selective reporting may influence the distribution of variants reported in the CHAMP/CHBMP and EAHAD databases. Moreover, data in the CHAMP/CHBMP databases are presented as a list of unique variants and not as a list of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, whereas the EAHAD database allows the data to be visualized both ways. In addition, as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study [14], the CDC tested >1400 patients with hemophilia A and >220 patients with hemophilia B and reported their variant results in a separate Excel file (CHAMP/CHBMP United States [US] files). 

4: In this study, we described the full spectrum of pathogenic F8/F9 variants in the PedNet cohort and compared how this population-based spectrum conformed to the spectrum of variants found in the established reference databases of EAHAD and CHAMP/CHBMP [[11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, we showed that the data from the PedNet cohort could serve as a reference for studies in previously untreated patients (PUPs). 

5: FVIII/FIX levels were measured at least twice, locally at the participating center, by either chromogenic or one-stage assay methods and the severity of hemophilia was defined. The PedNet Registry follows the international classification for hemophilia for severe (FVIII/FIX <1%), and moderate hemophilia (FVIII/FIX, 1%–5%) [15]. For mild hemophilia, only patients with factor levels 6%–25% were included [16]. 

6: Genotyping was performed locally by each center’s established routines, testing for inversions and predominantly using Sanger sequencing. In more recent years, next-generation sequencing has been used in some centers. All genetic reports provided to the coordinating center were checked and revised according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. In addition, all genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria and terminology [17,18]. In most genetic reports, only the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was reported, but in some cases second variants, eg, polymorphisms, were reported. In this article, only the pathogenic variants causing hemophilia A or hemophilia B were used. 

7: At the time of data extraction, 2278 boys and 19 females were included in the PedNet Registry. For this study, females were excluded from further analysis. Information on the F8 or F9 variant was available for 1941 patients (85%): 86% (1631/1904) patients with hemophilia A and 83% (310/374) patients with hemophilia B. With respect to disease severity, genetic analysis was performed in 92%, 77%, and 78% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia A, and in 88%, 84%, and 76% of patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia B, respectively. No disease-causing variants were found in 35 patients with hemophilia A and 5 patients with hemophilia B (2% and 1%, respectively). Genetic testing was performed in 84% of patients with hemophilia A with a known family history (n = 898/1073), in 89% of sporadic cases (n = 696/786), and in 82% of patients without the information on family history (n = 37/45). In addition, genetic testing was performed in 80% patients with hemophilia B having a known family history (n = 187/234), in 88% of sporadic cases (n = 116/132), and in 88% of patients without the information on family history (n = 7/8). The distribution of variant effects is shown in Table 1 (for hemophilia A) and Table 2 (for hemophilia B).Table 1Distribution of variant effects across severities in boys with hemophilia A, included in the PedNet Registry.MissenseNonsenseSilentSplice sitePromoterFrameshiftSmall structural change (<50 bp)Large structural change (>50 bp)IntronInversionTotalSevere151 (13)110 (9.6)38 (3.3)1 (0.6)194 (16.9)3 (0.3)40 (3.5)614 (53.3)1151Moderate157 (91.3)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)6 (3.5)5 (2.9)1 (0.6)1 (0.6)172Mild293 (95.1)1 (0.3)3 (1.0)3 (1.0)2 (0.6)4 (1.3)2 (0.6)308Total601111247419964426151631Only male patients with a known variant are shown in the Table.Data are presented as numbers (percentage).

8: In patients with both moderate (n = 172) and mild (n = 308) hemophilia A, missense variants encompassed the most common variant effect and accounted for 157 of the moderate (91%) and 293 of the mild cases (95%). However, although among patients with moderate hemophilia A these variants were almost equally distributed between the A1 (19%), A2 (23%), A3 (21%), and C1 (21%) domains, they were located most frequently in the A2 domain (40%) in patients with mild hemophilia A (Figure 1A).Figure 1Location of missense variants in moderate and mild hemophilia. (A) Location according to the factor VIII protein domains in moderate or mild hemophilia A; (B) Location according to the factor IX protein structure in moderate or mild hemophilia B. GLA: c-carboxy glutamic acid domain; EGF: epidermal growth factor like domain; ACT-Peptide: activating peptide 

9: In both moderate (n = 79) and mild (n = 71) hemophilia B, missense variants represented the causative variant effect in most patients: 68 of moderate and 61 of mild cases (86% each). As in hemophilia A, the distribution of these variants differed between moderate and mild hemophilia B. Most missense variants occurred in the serine protease domain in both groups (51% for moderate hemophilia B and 60% for mild hemophilia B). Yet, mild hemophilia B was associated more frequently with variants in the EGF1-domain whereas variants in the pro-peptide or linker were found less frequently (Figure 1B). The distribution of missense variants between the heavy and light chains was very similar among patients with hemophilia B. 

10: For the comparison between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP/CHBMP US files, only inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A were included. The spectrum in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was almost identical between the databases (Figure 2).Figure 2Spectrum of variant effects in the PedNet cohort compared with the CHAMP/CHBMP US files and EAHAD database. (A) inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A;(B) severe hemophilia B patients. Data are presented in percentages. 

11: Comparing the PedNet cohort to the EAHAD and CHBMP database, missense variants were the most prevalent variant effects in each database (Figure 2). 

12: First of all, we found that 50% of our patients with severe hemophilia A had an intron 22 inversion, compared with 43% in the CHAMP-US cohort and a widely accepted prevalence of approximately 45% [19]. However, the PedNet cohort is the first large and population-based cohort providing data on the prevalence of intron 22 inversions and should therefore be considered as an additional benchmark. Additionally, the distribution of variant effects in inversion-negative patients with severe hemophilia A was very similar between the PedNet cohort and the EAHAD database and CHAMP-US file: frameshift, missense, and nonsense variants were the most frequent variant effects in these patients. In patients with severe hemophilia B, missense variants occurred most commonly, a finding that was again comparable to the other databases. 

13: Next, we studied the distribution of variants in patients with nonsevere hemophilia. Although missense variants were the most frequent variant effects both in patients with moderate and mild hemophilia, we found that their location differed depending on the severity of the disease. Indeed, missense variants associated with mild hemophilia A were located most frequently in the A2 domain, whereas these were more evenly distributed between the A1, A2, A3, and C1 domains in moderate cases. Consequently, the heavy chain was more likely to be affected in patients with mild hemophilia A than in those with moderate hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, variants in mild hemophilia B occurred more frequently in the EGF1 domain but less frequently in the pro-peptide and linker than in moderate hemophilia B. The impact of variants on the FVIII or FIX protein structure and consequently on the disease severity is a topic of current research [[20], [21], [22], [23]] and evidence is emerging that phenotypic variation may also be related to the region where the variant occurs. [20,21] However, the role of the location of the variant warrants further exploration. 

14: In addition, no disease-causing variant could be identified in the respective genes in 2% of our patients with hemophilia A and 1% of patients with hemophilia B, which is comparable with the CHAMP data and with some reports [[24], [25], [26]], but low in comparison with other studies, that failed to identify a disease-causing variant in up to 11% of the patients. [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]] Of note, recent evolutions in genetic testing have improved variant detection and may explain the differences between various studies. 

15: Furthermore, we also evaluated whether the spectrum of variants in severe hemophilia was different according to the family history. Interestingly, missense variants were less common in sporadic cases of severe hemophilia A, whereas in patients with severe hemophilia B no differences were observed. A study by Lu et al. [32] reported similar results in patients with hemophilia B, but a comparison of the spectrum between sporadic and familial cases has not yet been studied extensively. Note that the definition of sporadic cases in our cohort is based on the lack of other symptomatic/diagnosed cases in the family rather than on the genetic test result of the patient’s mother. Importantly, haplotyping in hemophilia B has shown that, particularly in mild disease, seemingly sporadic cases could be related without anyone knowing [33], which may influence our observations. 

16: Finally, in view of inhibitor development, it is extremely important to have a correct variant spectrum frame to interpret the results of studies in PUPs in the light of their representation as the hemophilia population. Three LSDBs are currently used: CHAMP (F8 variants), CHBMP (F9 variants), and EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases (F8 and F9 variants). The development of these databases has much improved the accessibility of information on the location of a variant within the gene, the associated disease severity, and the risk of inhibitor development. In addition, all variants described in these databases conform to a common nomenclature following the Human Genome Variation Society guidelines. Nevertheless, these LSDBs have some limitations. First, they have been built starting from previous LSDBs or central mutation databases, supplemented and updated with variants found through literature searches or through submission by individual laboratories or researchers. Therefore, a reporting bias can affect their accuracy and completeness. Next, the CHAMP/CHMBP Mutation Lists are listings of variants. As they do not indicate the number of patients whose disease is caused by a particular variant, extrapolating the frequency of a variant to frequencies of patients affected by that variant is not possible based on these data. Indeed, the CHAMP Mutation List only includes 2 listings for inversion (ie, intron 1 inversion and intron 22 inversion), although over 40% of cases of severe hemophilia A are caused by inversions. On the contrary, in the CHAMP/CHBMP US files, each row does correspond to a patient included in the population-based Haemophilia Inhibitor Research Study Investigators [14]. Finally, F8 inversions are not listed in the EAHAD database. In this study, we report the full spectrum of F8/F9 variants in a multicenter large population-based cohort of PUPs affected with hemophilia A or B. Therefore, the spectrum of variants presented here can serve as a population-based reference and could be useful in future studies, although the database itself is not freely accessible. 

17: Our study has some limitations. First, the PedNet Registry only collects data from patients younger than 18 years. Additionally, patients with mild hemophilia and FVIII or FIX levels above 25% were not included. Thus, patients with mild hemophilia and/or a less severe phenotype may be underrepresented, especially if there was no known family history. However, in 2001 and again in 2014, the Scientific Subcommittee on Factor VIII and Factor IX and Rare Coagulation Disorders of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommended classifying hemophilia as mild if the plasma FVIII or FIX levels were between 5% and 40% [15,34]. Therefore, the EAHAD coagulation factor variant databases and the CHAMP/CHBMP US files may include patients with mild hemophilia having FVIII or FIX levels between 25% and 40%, whereas the PedNet registry does not. Second, some females with hemophilia are included in the PedNet Registry, but they most likely do not represent all female patients with hemophilia. Therefore, data on females have not been analyzed in this study. Additionally, detailed information on ethnicity is not available and although we included patients from Europe, Canada and Israel, some ethnic groups may be underrepresented. In addition, we do not report on second variants. Although 2 pathogenic variants are probably rare and the clinical significance is still unresolved [[35], [36], [37], [38]], they should be considered in patients with a known disease-causing variant but unusual phenotype, but also in genetic counseling settings. Finally, genetic analysis has not been performed in some patients. Patients with severe hemophilia A and severe or moderate hemophilia B were more likely to be tested but genetic testing was less frequently performed in patients with severe hemophilia A having a known family history, most likely because the disease-causing variant was already known. However, reporting the variant is not allowed in the PedNet Registry, unless confirmed in the patient himself. This may have caused a bias in our data.

          Introduction:
          Deficiency of factor VIII (Hemophilia A), factor IX (Hemophilia B) and Von Willebrand's factor are the most frequent coagulation defects. The incidence of inhibitors in patients of factor VIII deficiency is varies in different regions of India.
        
        
          Aim:
          To determine the prevalence, clinical profile and incidence of formation of inhibitors in patients of Hemophilia in north eastern part of India.
        
        
          Methods:
          Selected patients were under went for complete Blood Count (CBC), General Blood Picture (GBP), Prothrombin time (PT), Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Thrombin time, Correction experiment to know the specific factor deficiency or inhibitors present by Normal Plasma, Normal aged serum, Al(OH)3 adsorbed plasma.
        
        
          Results:
          92 patients diagnosed as suffering with Hemophilia A or B were included in study. The age of patients ranged from 2.5 month to 53 years. Out of 92, seventy nine (85.87%) were Haemophilia A and thirteen were (14.13%) Hemophilia B patients. 3.50% (2/55) cases of treated Hemophilia A patient develop inhibitor.
        
        
          Conclusion:
          The prevalence of hemophilia and incidence of inhibitors in these patients is varies in different regions of India. This variation may be due to the type of product used as treatment, intensity of treatment or the genetic characteristics of the patients.

0: Deficiency of factor VIII (Hemophilia A), factor IX (Hemophilia B) and Von Willebrand's factor are the most frequent coagulation defects. Hereditary deficiencies of other coagulation factors are significantly less common.[1] In geographic or ethnic populations where consanguineous unions are common, recessively inherited bleeding disorders are more common. Hemophilia A occurs in 1 out of 10,000 male births, while hemophilia B, occurs in 1 out of 30,000 male births. The prevalence of haemophilia A varies with the reporting country, with a range of 5.4-14.5 cases per 100,000 male individuals.[23] 

1: The most serious complication of replacement therapy in hemophilia is the development of inhibitors.[4] An inhibitor is a polyclonal high-affinity immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is directed against the FVIII protein. These antibodies can be either inhibitory or non inhibitory. Factor VIII have different types of domains. Antibody binding at these domains results in functional impairment of factor VIII. Development of these antibodies leads to an increase in the management cost, morbidity and mortality. The incidence of inhibitors in patients of factor VIII deficiency varies in different regions of India. This variation may be due to the type of product used as treatment, intensity of treatment or the genetic characteristics of the patients.[56] Antibodies to factor IX are rare in comparison to factor VIII, and seen only in 1-3% of hemophilia B patients. The data related to the inhibitors and prevalence of hemophilia are lacking from this part of country. 

2: A control mixture is prepared by mixing Factor VIII deficient plasma and buffered-normal plasma pool and is also incubated. After 2 hours the Factor VIII activity of each mixture is measured. The Factor VIII of the test mixture is compared to that of the control and the percentage of residual Factor VIII is calculated. One Bethesda unit (BU) is defined as that amount of inhibitor in the test plasma (patient) that results in 50% residual Factor VIII activity. Dilutions of patient plasma are also tested. A patient plasma producing a residual Factor VIII activity of 50% in an incubation mixture is considered to contain one Bethesda unit per mL. Relationship between the residual factor VIII activity in normal plasma and the inhibitor activity of the test plasma can be read off this plot. At 50% inhibition, the test plasma contains, by definition, 1 Bethesda inhibitor unit per ml. Note that the y-axis is a logarithmic scale [Figure 1]. 

3: 92 patients diagnosed as suffering with Hemophilia A or B were included in study. The age of patients ranged from 2.5 months to 53 years. In our study, maximum number of patients were in age group 11-15 years. [Table 1] All patients were male. In our study, family history was present in 64.13% of patients, consanguinity was present in 5.43% of patients, 3.26% consanguineous patients were positive for family history. In our study, most common presenting clinical feature was Prolonged bleeding after cut (79.34%) [Table 2]. More than 3 joints were involved in 21.87% of haemophilia A patients. Arthropathy/deformity was present in 18.75% of patients. Bilateral knee joints were involved in 15.38% of Hemophilia B patients. Arthropathy/deformity was present in 7.69% of patients [Table 3]. The mean for PT was 14.06 ± 1.06 while mean for APPT was 80.33 ± 19.20 [Table 4]. Out of 92, 79 (85.87%) were Haemophilia A and 13 were (14.13%) Hemophilia B patients. The Mean Factor VIII value was 47.58 ± 29.33 (P value < 0.001). Factor IX assay was done in 48 patients. Mean Factor IX value was 108.60 ± 23.93 (P value < 0.001). 63.298% patients of Haemophilia A were having <1% factor VIII concentration. In our study 61.54% cases of Haemophilia B were having <1% factor IX. [Table 5]. 36.70% patients were having transfusion ≥3 times, 37.97% were having <3 times. 3.50% (2/55) cases of treated Hemophilia A patient develop inhibitor. Table 6 showed the details of the patients with factor VIII inhibitors. 

4: In the present study, a total of 92 patients with abnormal bleeding manifestations were investigated. Amongst these, 85.87% (79/92) was suffering from Hemophilia A, whereas 14.13% (13/79) from Hemophilia B. The age at presentation of disease ranged from 2.5 months to 53 years, out of which 61.96% (57/92) patients belong to paediatric age group (0-18 years) and 38.04% (35/92) patients belongs to adult age group (19-53 years). Maximum number of patients 25% (23/92) were of the age group 11-15 years, followed by the age group 21-30 years 19.56% (18/92) >1-5 years 18.48% (17/92)>16-20 years (14.13%)>6-10 years (10.96%) > less than 1 year, and the minimum number of patients belongs to more than 31 years’ age group. Mean age was 11.25 ± 8.84, median age of the patients was 10 years and the most frequent age i.e. mode was 15 years. In a study done by Gupta et al. the age at presentation ranged from 2-47 years with a median age of 32.2 years.[7] Sajid et al. reported the age at presentation ranged from 3 to 57 years with a median age of 17 years. Mostly patients with mild deficiency presented and diagnosed in adult group.[8] Munira et al. reported mean age of 15.8 years.[9] All patients in the present study were male. As Haemophilia A and B are X-linked disorders, it most commonly affect males, female act as carrier. In the present study, most common presenting clinical feature in was prolonged bleeding after cut (79.34%) >Ecchymosis/bruise (45.65%) >Haemarthrosis (41.30%) >Haematoma (30.43%) >Petechiae (13.04%) >Epistaxis (8.69%) and Gum bleeding (8.69%) >Bleeding after tooth extraction (4.34%) >Bleeding after tonsillectomy (3.26%) >Post circumcision bleeding (3.26%) >Umbilical bleeding (3.26%) >Haematuria (2.17%) and least common Haematemesis (1.08%). Ahmed et al. reported most common presenting feature in hemophilia as hemarthrosis (82%).[10] Munira Borhany et al. reported Haemarthrosis in 72.85%, Haematoma (51.4%), post circumcision bleeding (37.14%), Bleeding after trauma (28.51%) followed by haematuria, bruise, gum bleeding.[9] In the present study, 40.50% have experienced joint swelling at least once in life involving one, two or multiple joints, most commonly knee joint. Sajid et al. also reported knee joint as most common joint involvement (48%) and in 36% more than one joint was involved.[8] 63.29% (50/79) cases of hemophilia A were having <1% factor VIIIc designated as severe hemophilia A, 22.78% (18/79) were having 1-5% factor VIIIc designated as moderate hemophilia A and 13.92% (11/79) were having > 5% factor VIIIc designated as mild hemophilia A. In a study by Ahmed et al. 77.8% cases of severe hemophilia A. 14.4% of moderate hemophilia A, and 7.75% cases of mild hemophilia A were reported.[10] Sajid et al. reported 37.2% (79) mild, 41% (87) moderate, 21.6% (46) severe Haemophilia A out of 212 patients of Haemophilia A.[8] These data are comparable with clinical presentation of the patients. Patients having very less concentration of factor VIIIc presented to clinics due to very severe symptoms, while patients with mild to moderate factor VIIIc deficiency did not came to clinics because symptoms were less server and managed locally. In present study, 61.54% cases of hemophilia B having <1% factor IX designated as severe hemophilia B, 23.08% cases of hemophilia B were having 1-5% of factor IX designated as moderate hemophilia B, and 15.38% cases were having 5-50% of factor IX concentration designated as mild hemophilia B. In the study of Ahmed et al., hemophilia B patients have 69.6% severe, 19.2% moderate and 11.2% mild disease.[10] Haemophila can be referred to as a disorder that causes joint damage leading to limitation in conducting daily activities and changes in social functioning. In the developed countries haemophiliacs have a quality of life very similar to that seen in general population due to provision of safety factor concentrates and multidisciplinary comprehensive care approach, but in countries like ours, haemophiliacs are not treated with safe products and appropriate qualities of the products because of cost related issues, so lack of adequate treatment can result in pain, arthropathy and disability. Although hemarthrosis was the leading cause of presenting feature of the haemophilia in children in the present setting, bruises and hematoma either spontaneous or traumatic were the main features at very onset of presentation of these children. So, the presence of these features in an otherwise normal child should be considered for evaluation of hemophilia. Out of 79 hemophilia A patients, 59 (74.68%) have received treatment more than once in form of whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or recombinant factor VIII. These patients have been transfused with either whole blood (10.2%), fresh frozen plasma (33.9%), recombinant FVIII (32.2%), or combination of recombinant FVIII + fresh frozen plasma + whole blood (23.8%). Amongst these, 50.8% (30/59) patients received transfusion less than 3 times and 49.2% (29/59) received transfusion more than 3 times. Therefore, only these patients were subjected for antibody detection against factor VIII by the mixing studies. In the present study, we found factor VIII inhibitor in only 2 out of 59 (3.39%) treated patients. One of the patients had inhibitor titre of 8BU, and the other had 4BU. The details of these patients have shown in Table 6. Wight and Paisley, reported an overall inhibitor prevalence of 5-7% and when limited to patients with severe disease is much higher at 12-13%.[11] Lusher et al. reported incidence of new factor inhibitor in patients with severe factor VIII deficiency is approximately 30%. About 60% of those inhibitors are of high titer (>5BU) and remaining (40%) are of low titre (<5BU).[12] Most factor VIII allo antibodies are directed against epitopes in the A2 and A3-C1 domain of factor VIII, or auto antibodies, those that suddenly appear in person with normal factor VIII gene and previously normal plasma level of plasma factor VIII, causing acquired hemophilia.[131415] Factor affecting development of inhibitor classified as non-modifiable and modifiable. Non-modifiable risk factors include high risk hemophilia genotype, co-stimulatory genotype-immuno genotype interaction, ethnicity and positive family history. Modifiable risk factors include environmental influence that is implicated in increasing the risk of inhibitor formation. Environment factors include age at start of prophylaxis, type of replacement therapy product and intensity of treatment.[1016] In India, for hemophilia, inhibitor screening and other genetic test are not available therefore the identification and management of these patients is difficult. Care of haemophilia is complex, often requiring health management beyond the prevention and treatment of bleeding. Medical experts like family physician or physiotherapists can help in managing the recovery from bleeding or can apply aggressive hemostatic techniques or can assist patients capable of self administered factor therapy.[17]
